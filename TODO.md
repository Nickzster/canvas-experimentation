# Entity Component System

This repository is a very simple implementation of an engine utilizing the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture.

## TODO

- [ ] Look into integrating TypeScript
- [ ] Add `onCollisionEnter` and `onCollisionExit` handlers for collision components.
- [ ] Add better collision checks
- [ ] Optimize collision system (since algorithm is O(n^2) )
- [ ] Optimize component lookup via signatures
- [ ] Build a player controller system
- [ ] Add a `CircleComponent` and `CircleCollisionComponent`.
- [ ] Add an `ImageComponent`, where sprites can be used to draw shapes.
- [ ] Look into physics (either a simple implementation or utilize a library like matter.js)
- [ ] Look into rotations (may require quaternions)
